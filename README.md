#  Code Challenge

## Summary of test

For this code challenge, I will create a section of a landing page that displays the offerings from . It will include 3 tabbed sections that automatically switches tabs until the user navigates to a tab on their own. On mobile, it simply provides 3 sections with horizontal scrolling.

## Requirements

- Matches Design
- Responsive
- Automatically swaps tabs
  - Progress bar shows time until swap
  - Pauses when the links are not in the viewport
- Clicking a tab link swaps to the tab
  - This also stops the auto swapping
- Mobile shows all 3 sections with horizontal scrolling

## Tech Stack

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

You can find the most recent version of this guide [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).

## Installation

- Change directory into the directory of the project and install the node modules with

  `npm i` or `yarn`

- To run the project locally with react-scritps type:

  `npm run start` or `yarn start`

  The dev webpage will open automatically or otherwise can be found at `localhost:3000`

- To serve the built folder type:

  `npm i -g serve` (if not installed)

  `serve -s build`

  You will then be able to visit it on `localhost:5000`

## The Process

## Sketching the app

I always try to visualize where the components will be in the Design, and make sure they make sense for the app and logic.

## App Skeleton

I always have a starter template which I created and updated every time I found some new and better ways to do things in code.

It contains improvements, performance tweaks and several components that I might need.

In this case I used some of those improvements (ie. `.env` file for styles alias) that I found.

## Refining

Once that's in place, I make sure I only keep what's really needed and try to scrap the rest (console logs, useless comments and TODOs that I have completed).

It won't be compiled, but it would pollute the repository.

## Git init

From here on, you can see the commits in the repo I will share via e-mail (or pull request).
